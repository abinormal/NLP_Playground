# NLP_Playground
A fun tinker with some NLP. Using the NLTK. Constructive Criticism welcomed as it has been a long time since I've written any Python and I'll bet this looks a lot like C.

From the NLTK library: Lemmatisation, tokenization, stopwords
and the CLI library argparse

To run you'll need to download all or just some of the NLTK packages. Uncommenting line 13 to open the GUI.
nltk.download()  # uncomment to download nltk packages
