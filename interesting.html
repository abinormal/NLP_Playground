This is now the reality of Iraq.</p><p>It’s not clear that these troop levels are sustainable for a significant period of time, and according to our commanders on the ground, adding American forces will only relieve the Iraqis from doing more on their own.</p><p>In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the American people ?</p><p>And polls show that almost two-thirds of all Iraqis now sympathize with attacks on American soldiers.</p><p>Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers.</p><p>and that is the loss of our government’s credibility with the American people.</p><p>Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it.</p><p>And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education.</p><p>Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single American.</p><p>It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road.</p><p>We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President - when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush.</p><p>My own city of Chicago has been the home of some of the most corrupt local politics in American history, from patronage machines to questionable elections.</p><p>As a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the U.S. troops remaining in Iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and American enclaves like the Green Zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists.</p><p>Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time.</p><p>But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at American University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet Union.</p><p>And ever since I met this frail, one-hundred-and-five-year-old African-American woman who had found the strength to leave her house and come to a rally because she believed that her voice mattered, I've thought about all she's seen in her life.</p><p>Because we've always fought to bring all of our people under the blanket of the American Dream.</p><p>This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive.</p><p>And now, after three long years of watching the same back and forth in Washington, the American people have sent a clear message that the days of using the war on terror as a political football are over.</p><p>We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes.</p><p>It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.</p><p>The addition of 4,000 American troops in Baghdad has not succeeded in securing that increasingly perilous city.</p><p>Throughout American history, there have been moments that call on us to meet the challenges of an uncertain world, and pay whatever price is required to secure our freedom.</p><p>And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win.</p><p>Iraq is descending into chaos based on ethnic divisions that were around long before American troops arrived.</p><p>It's time to admit that no amount of American lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil war.</p><p>It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work.</p><p>Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land - enough!</p></td></tr><tr ><td ><h3><span id = "people"></span>People (69)</h3><p><a href="#top">Back</a></p></td><td><p>doc5.txt</p><p>doc2.txt</p><p>doc1.txt</p><p>doc4.txt</p><p>doc6.txt</p><p>doc3.txt</p></td><td><p>In a true democracy, it is what happens between elections that is the true measure of how a government treats its people.</p><p>Outstanding career officials who run the Nunn-Lugar program -- people like Col. Jim Reid and Andy Weber who are here this morning -- will be there every step of the way to ensure that U.S. interests are protected.</p><p>Some of the worst actors on the international stage can also take advantage of the collective exhaustion and outrage that people feel with official corruption, as we've seen with Islamic extremists who promise purification, but deliver totalitarianism.</p><p>A few Tuesdays ago, the American people embraced this seriousness with regards to America’s policy in Iraq.</p><p>In the face of a politics that's shut you out, that's told you to settle, that's divided us for too long, you believe we can be one people, reaching for what's possible, building that more perfect union.</p><p>How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement?</p><p>And she saw people lining up to vote for the first time - and she got in that line - and she never forgot it.</p><p>When people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups.</p><p>the American people have determined that all these phrases have become meaningless in the face of a conflict that grows more deadly and chaotic with each passing day ?</p><p>The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels.</p><p>Today, the Iraqi landscape is littered with ill-conceived, half-finished projects that have done almost nothing to help the Iraqi people or stabilize the country.</p><p>do not just come from deposing a tyrant and handing out ballots; they are only realized once the personal and material security of a people is ensured as well.</p><p>The history of Africa is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of people fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like Nkrumah and Kenyatta and Mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from Ghana to South Africa, to secure self-determination in the face of great odds.</p><p>Of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see.</p><p>And I understood the question because it revealed the cynicism people feel about public life today.</p><p>One that serves its people and is free from corruption.</p><p>To begin with, I discovered the warmth and sense of community that the people of Kenya possess - their sense of hopefulness even in the face of great difficulty.</p><p>But through his will and his words, he moved a nation and helped free a people.</p><p>The American people have been extraordinarily resolved.</p><p>And she saw young people of every race and every creed take a bus down to Mississippi and Alabama to register voters because they believed.</p><p>In the face of Depression, we put people back to work and lifted millions out of poverty.</p><p>And I know that the vast majority of people in this country desperately want to change this.</p><p>Today, we're starting to see that the Kenyan people want more than a simple changing of the guard, more than piecemeal reforms to a crisis that's crippling their country.</p><p>I know from these stories that my father was not a perfect man - that he made his share of mistakes and disappointed his share of people in his lifetime.</p><p>It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America.</p><p>And we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe.</p><p>That beneath all the differences of race and region, faith and station, we are one people.</p><p>In the end, if the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost.</p><p>I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars.</p><p>We're distracted from our real failures, and told to blame the other party, or gay people, or immigrants.</p><p>It's a time where you can go to any town hall or street corner or coffee shop and hear people express the same anxiety about the future; hear them convey the same uncertainty about the direction we're headed as a country.</p><p>Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made.</p><p>The Kenyan people are the ultimate guardians against abuses.</p><p>In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the American people ?</p><p>Because people just couldn't pronounce it.</p><p>The sweeping changes brought by revolutions in technology have torn down walls between business and government and people and places all over the globe.</p><p>A foreign policy that gives hope and opportunity to the people of this great continent.</p><p>The President should announce to the Iraqi people that our policy will include a gradual and substantial reduction in U.S. forces.</p><p>and that is the loss of our government’s credibility with the American people.</p><p>But while corruption is a problem we all share, here in Kenya it is a crisis - a crisis that's robbing an honest people of the opportunities they have fought for - the opportunity they deserve.</p><p>And as people have looked away in disillusionment and frustration, we know what's filled the void.</p><p>And the second thing people would ask me was, "You seem like a nice young man.</p><p>I joined with pastors and lay-people to deal with communities that had been ravaged by plant closings.</p><p>In the young people who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved again after a very long time.</p><p>Whether it's the war or Katrina or their health care or their jobs, you hear people say that we've finally arrived at a moment where something must change.</p><p>But too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own.</p><p>It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst.</p><p>Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism.</p><p>Looking out at this crowd of young people, I have faith that you will fight this fight too.</p><p>Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time.</p><p>For that is our unyielding faith - that in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it.</p><p>Because we've always fought to bring all of our people under the blanket of the American Dream.</p><p>It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as Americans.</p><p>I don't think this administration is full of stupid people - I think there are a lot of smart folks in there.</p><p>We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma.</p><p>But what the people heard instead - people of every creed and color, from every walk of life - is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked.</p><p>Instead of opening businesses and engaging in commerce, people come to rely on patronage and payback as a means of advancing.</p><p>Now, few people understand these challenges better than the co-founder of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Dick Lugar, and this is something that became particularly clear to me during one incident on the trip.</p><p>Our faith has been shaken, but the people running Washington aren't willing to make us believe again.</p><p>The Kenyan media has been courageous in uncovering and reporting on some of the most blatant abuses of the system, and there has been a growing recognition among people and politicians that this is a critical issue.</p><p>I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill.</p><p>And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win.</p><p>And now, after three long years of watching the same back and forth in Washington, the American people have sent a clear message that the days of using the war on terror as a political football are over.</p><p>If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from.</p><p>Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land - enough!</p></td></tr><tr ><td ><h3><span id = "country"></span>Country (68)</h3><p><a href="#top">Back</a></p></td><td><p>doc5.txt</p><p>doc2.txt</p><p>doc1.txt</p><p>doc4.txt</p><p>doc3.txt</p></td><td><p>By rejecting the insulting idea that corruption is somehow a part of Kenyan culture, these heroes reveal the very opposite - they reveal a strength and integrity of character that can build a great country, a great future.</p><p>That policy-by-slogan will no longer pass as an acceptable form of debate in this country.</p><p>And so I am eager to have this argument not just with the President, but the entire Republican Party over what this country is about.</p><p>This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich.</p><p>I think he loves his country.</p><p>Today, the Iraqi landscape is littered with ill-conceived, half-finished projects that have done almost nothing to help the Iraqi people or stabilize the country.</p><p>Since that time I have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those I heard from my relatives here in Kenya on my last trip to this country.</p><p>When people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups.</p><p>I don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a country truly committed to reform could start.</p><p>Will she see a country that is freer and kinder, more tolerant and more just than the one she grew up in?</p><p>This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news.</p><p>Of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see.</p><p>You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country.</p><p>This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work.</p><p>A year that is ending with an attempt by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group to determine what can be done about a country that is quickly spiraling out of control.</p><p>According to a Pew survey, 42% of Americans now agree with the statement that the U.S. should "mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own.”
We cannot afford to be a country of isolationists right now.</p><p>We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country.</p><p>For only through this phased redeployment can we send a clear message to the Iraqi factions that the U.S. is not going to hold together this country indefinitely ?</p><p>Will she see greater opportunities for every citizen of this country?</p><p>All of us running for president will travel around the country offering ten-point plans and making grand speeches; all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead the country.</p><p>And I know that the vast majority of people in this country desperately want to change this.</p><p>Today, we're starting to see that the Kenyan people want more than a simple changing of the guard, more than piecemeal reforms to a crisis that's crippling their country.</p><p>But to guard against isolationist sentiments in this country, we must change conditions in Iraq and the policy that has characterized our time there ?</p><p>To reach such a solution, we must communicate clearly and effectively to the factions in Iraq that the days of asking, urging, and waiting for them to take control of their own country are coming to an end.</p><p>And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight.</p><p>It's a time where you can go to any town hall or street corner or coffee shop and hear people express the same anxiety about the future; hear them convey the same uncertainty about the direction we're headed as a country.</p><p>And you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger Kenya where everyone rises together.</p><p>The first is that we should be more modest in our belief that we can impose democracy on a country through military force.</p><p>And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education.</p><p>As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with Kenya and with Africa.</p><p>We know as well the talent, the intelligence, and the creativity that exists in this country.</p><p>And we should take heart, because we've changed this country before.</p><p>He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words:

This is now the reality of Iraq.</p><p>There is one other place where our mistakes in Iraq have cost us dearly ?</p><p>But neither Iran nor Syria want to see a security vacuum in Iraq filled with

decision to go to war in Iraq have argued that it has been a failure of implementation.</p><p>The third part of our strategy should be to link continued economic aid in Iraq with the existence of tangible progress toward a political settlement.</p><p>As a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the U.S. troops remaining in Iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and American enclaves like the Green Zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists.</p><p>threats we haven’t paid nearly enough attention to because we have been distracted in Iraq.</p><p>The President’s decision to go to war in Iraq has had disastrous consequences for Afghanistan -- we have seen a fierce Taliban offensive, a spike in terrorist attacks, and a narcotrafficking problem spiral out of control.</p><p>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.</p><p>Rather, the question is what strategies, imperfect though they may be, are most likely to achieve the best outcome in Iraq, one that will ultimately put us on a more effective course to deal with international terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and other critical threats to our security.</p><p>I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan.</p><p>namely, preventing Iraq from becoming what Afghanistan once was, maintaining our influence in the Middle East, and forging a political settlement to stop the sectarian violence so that our troops can come home.</p><p>A year in which well-respected Republicans like John Warner, former Administration officials like Colin Powell, generals who have served in Iraq, and intelligence experts have all said that what we are doing is not working.</p><p>As we change strategy in Iraq, we should also think about what

occupying Iraq.</p><p>Last week, without a trace of irony, the President even chose Vietnam as the backdrop for remarks counseling “patience” with his policies in Iraq.</p><p>The notion that Iraq would quickly and easily become a bulwark of flourishing democracy in the Middle East was not a plan for victory, but an ideological fantasy.</p><p>The goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of Iraq, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various Iraqi factions towards a political solution.</p><p>We would make clear in such a scenario that the United States would not be maintaining permanent military bases in Iraq, but would do what was necessary to help prevent a total collapse of the Iraqi state and further polarization of Iraqi society.</p><p>The time for waiting in Iraq is over.</p><p>Finally, we have to realize that the entire Middle East has an enormous stake in the outcome of Iraq, and we must engage neighboring countries in finding a solution.</p><p>And a report by our own intelligence agencies has concluded that al Qaeda is successfully using the war in Iraq to recruit a new generation of terrorists for its war on America.</p><p>Now, I am hopeful that the Iraq Study Group emerges next month with a series of proposals around which we can begin to build a bipartisan consensus.</p><p>So far, Congress has given the Administration unprecedented flexibility in determining how to spend more than $20 billion dollars in Iraq.</p><p>Much has been written about how the military invasion of Iraq was planned without any thought to what political situation we would find after Baghdad fell.</p><p>Iraq is descending into chaos based on ethnic divisions that were around long before American troops arrived.</p><p>I said then and believe now that Saddam Hussein was a ruthless dictator who craved weapons of mass destruction but posed no imminent threat to the United States; that a war in Iraq would harm, not help, our efforts to defeat al Qaeda and finish the job in Afghanistan; and that an invasion would require an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.</p><p>But all of this cannot come to pass until we bring an end to this war in Iraq.</p><p>I spoke here a year ago and delivered a message about Iraq that was similar to the one I did today.</p><p>In the

opportunity to bring the criminal to justice.</p><p>Of course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold War.</p><p>The National Intelligence Estimate, which details how we’re creating more terrorists in Iraq than we’re defeating, is the most obvious example of how the war is hurting our efforts in the larger battle against terrorism.</p><p>But even as they have carried out their responsibilities with excellence and valor, they have also told me that there is no military solution to this war.</p><p>Whether it's the war or Katrina or their health care or their jobs, you hear people say that we've finally arrived at a moment where something must change.</p><p>Many who supported the original decision to go to war in Iraq have argued that it has been a failure of implementation.</p><p>This kind of realism has been missing since the very conception of this war, and it is what led me to publicly oppose it in 2002.</p><p>For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight.</p><p>I've thought about how she lived to see a world war and a Great Depression and a second world war, and how she saw her brothers and uncles and nephews and cousins coming home from those wars and still have to sit at the back of a bus.</p><p>In the face of war, you believe there can be peace.</p><p>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.</p><p>The President’s decision to go to war in Iraq has had disastrous consequences for Afghanistan -- we have seen a fierce Taliban offensive, a spike in terrorist attacks, and a narcotrafficking problem spiral out of control.</p><p>I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan.</p><p>In a century just six years old, our faith has been shaken by war and terror, disaster and despair, threats to the middle-class dream, and scandal and corruption in our government.</p><p>The goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of Iraq, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various Iraqi factions towards a political solution.</p><p>Most of you know I opposed this war from the start.</p><p>And a report by our own intelligence agencies has concluded that al Qaeda is successfully using the war in Iraq to recruit a new generation of terrorists for its war on America.</p><p>that the rationale behind the war itself was misguided.</p><p>All of us know what those challenges are today - a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can.</p><p>Finally, there is one other thing that is not too late to get right about this war - and that is the homecoming of the men and women - our veterans - who have sacrificed the most.</p><p>Moreover, without a coherent strategy or better cooperation from the Iraqis, we would only be putting more of our soldiers in the crossfire of a civil war.</p><p>And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win.</p><p>Throughout the Cold War, the Soviet Union was engaged in a massive undertaking in the field of germ warfare.</p><p>2,867 Americans have now died in this war.</p><p>I said then and believe now that Saddam Hussein was a ruthless dictator who craved weapons of mass destruction but posed no imminent threat to the United States; that a war in Iraq would harm, not help, our efforts to defeat al Qaeda and finish the job in Afghanistan; and that an invasion would require an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.</p><p>But all of this cannot come to pass until we bring an end to this war in Iraq.</p><p>And now, after three long years of watching the same back and forth in Washington, the American people have sent a clear message that the days of using the war on terror as a political football are over.</p><p>For the fact is that there are no good options left in this war.</p></td></tr><tr ><td ><h3><span id = "promise"></span>Promise (39)</h3><p><a

on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States.</p><p>This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive.</p><p>What is that promise?</p><p>Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women - students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors -- found the courage to keep it alive.</p><p>It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.</p><p>The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight.</p><p>And just as we keep
