that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes.</p><p>It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.</p><p>And ever since I met this frail, one-hundred-and-five-year-old African-American woman who had found the strength to leave her house and come to a rally because she believed that her voice mattered, I've thought about all she's seen in her life.</p><p>And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win.</p><p>And now, after three long years of watching the same back and forth in Washington, the American people have sent a clear message that the days of using the war on terror as a political football are over.</p><p>If we do all this, if we can be trusted to lead, this will not be a Democratic Agenda, it will be an American agenda.</p><p>We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more.</p><p>That in a global economy that's more connected and more competitive - we are the party that will guarantee every American an affordable, world-class, top-notch, life-long education - from early childhood to high school, from college to on-the-job training.</p><p>It's time to admit that no amount of American lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil war.</p><p>In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the American people ?</p><p>A few Tuesdays ago, the American people embraced this seriousness with regards to America’s policy in Iraq.</p><p>It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work.</p><p>I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars.</p></td></tr><tr><td>people (69)</td><td><p>doc5.txt</p><p>doc4.txt</p><p>doc2.txt</p><p>doc1.txt</p><p>doc3.txt</p><p>doc6.txt</p></td><td><p>The President should announce to the Iraqi people that our policy will include a gradual and substantial reduction in U.S. forces.</p><p>But too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own.</p><p>Because we've always fought to bring all of our people under the blanket of the American Dream.</p><p>Today, the Iraqi landscape is littered with ill-conceived, half-finished projects that have done almost nothing to help the Iraqi people or stabilize the country.</p><p>and that is the loss of our government’s credibility with the American people.</p><p>It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised;

that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill.</p><p>do not just come from deposing a tyrant and handing out ballots; they are only realized once the personal and material security of a people is ensured as well.</p><p>We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma.</p><p>But while corruption is a problem we all share, here in Kenya it is a crisis - a crisis that's robbing an honest people of the opportunities they have fought for - the opportunity they deserve.</p><p>And we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe.</p><p>the American people have determined that all these phrases have become meaningless in the face of a conflict that grows more deadly and chaotic with each passing day ?</p><p>In the face of a politics that's shut you out, that's told you to settle, that's divided us for too long, you believe we can be one people, reaching for what's possible, building that more perfect union.</p><p>To begin with, I discovered the warmth and sense of community that the people of Kenya possess - their sense of hopefulness even in the face of great difficulty.</p><p>And as people have looked away in disillusionment and frustration, we know what's filled the void.</p><p>Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time.</p><p>We're distracted from our real failures, and told to blame the other party, or gay people, or immigrants.</p><p>And she saw people lining up to vote for the first time - and she got in that line - and she never forgot it.</p><p>For that is our unyielding faith - that in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it.</p><p>The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels.</p><p>The history of Africa is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of people fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like Nkrumah and Kenyatta and Mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from Ghana to South Africa, to secure self-determination in the face of great odds.</p><p>It's a time where you can go to any town hall or street corner or coffee shop and hear people express the same anxiety about the future; hear them convey the same uncertainty about the direction we're headed as a country.</p><p>Instead of opening businesses and engaging in commerce, people come to rely on patronage and payback as a means of advancing.</p><p>It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as Americans.</p><p>It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America.</p><p>Of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see.</p><p>Because people just couldn't pronounce it.</p><p>I don't think this administration is full of stupid people - I think there are a lot of smart folks in there.</p><p>And I know that the vast majority of people in this country desperately want to change this.</p><p>I know from these stories that my father was not a perfect man - that he made his share of mistakes and disappointed his share of people in his lifetime.</p><p>Our faith has been shaken, but the people running Washington aren't willing to make us believe again.</p><p>How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement?</p><p>And I understood the question because it revealed the cynicism people feel about public life today.</p><p>In the face of Depression, we put people back to work and lifted millions out of poverty.</p><p>I joined with pastors and lay-people to deal with communities that had been ravaged by plant closings.</p><p>In a true democracy, it is what happens between elections that is the true measure of how a government treats its people.</p><p>Now, few people understand these challenges better than the co-founder of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Dick Lugar, and this is something that became particularly clear to me during one incident on the trip.</p><p>And the second thing people would ask me was, "You seem like a nice young man.</p><p>Some of the worst actors on the international stage can also take advantage of the collective exhaustion and outrage that people feel with official corruption, as we've seen with Islamic extremists who promise purification, but deliver totalitarianism.</p><p>When people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups.</p><p>And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win.</p><p>And now, after three long years of watching the same back and forth in Washington, the American people have sent a clear message that the days of using the war on terror as a political football are over.</p><p>Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made.</p><p>In the young people who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved again after a very long time.</p><p>Outstanding career officials who run the Nunn-Lugar program -- people like Col. Jim Reid and Andy Weber who are here this morning -- will be there every step of the way to ensure that U.S. interests are protected.</p><p>A few Tuesdays ago, the American people embraced this seriousness with regards to America’s policy in Iraq.</p><p>And she saw young people of every race and every creed take a bus down to Mississippi and Alabama to register voters because they believed.</p><p>In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the American people ?</p><p>Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism.</p><p>Today, we're starting to see that the Kenyan people want more than a simple changing of the guard, more than piecemeal reforms to a crisis that's crippling their country.</p><p>I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars.</p></td></tr><tr><td>country (68)</td><td><p>doc5.txt</p><p>doc4.txt</p><p>doc2.txt</p><p>doc1.txt</p><p>doc3.txt</p></td><td><p>All of us running for president will travel around the country offering ten-point plans and making grand speeches; all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead the country.</p><p>And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education.</p><p>This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work.</p><p>This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news.</p><p>Will she see a country that is freer and kinder, more tolerant and more just than the one she grew up in?</p><p>I've had enough of being told that we can't afford body armor for our troops and health care for our veterans and benefits for the wounded heroes who've risked their lives for this country.</p><p>I love this country, and so do you, and so does John McCain.</p><p>Today, the Iraqi landscape is littered with ill-conceived, half-finished projects that have done almost nothing to help the Iraqi people or stabilize the country.</p><p>But to guard against isolationist sentiments in this country, we must change conditions in Iraq and the policy that has characterized our time there ?</p><p>And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight.</p><p>You enjoy a robust civil society; a press that's free, fair, and honest; and a strong partnership with my own country that has resulted in critical cooperation on terrorist issues, real strides in fighting disease and poverty, and an important alliance on fostering regional stability.</p><p>And let's allow our unions and their organizers to lift up this country's middle-class again.</p><p>We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country.</p><p>Our time to leave our children a country that is freer and kinder, more prosperous and more just than the place we grew up.</p><p>The idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we're all in it together and everybody's got a shot at opportunity.</p><p>He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words:
Had enough?</p><p>Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third.</p><p>The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect.</p><p>Politics doesn't have to divide us on this anymore - we can work together to keep our country safe.</p><p>In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships.</p><p>This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich.</p><p>And I've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this country.</p><p>You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country.</p><p>For that is our unyielding faith - that in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it.</p><p>According to a Pew survey, 42% of Americans now agree with the statement that the U.S. should "mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own.”
We cannot afford to be a country of isolationists right now.</p><p>By rejecting the insulting idea that corruption is somehow a part of Kenyan culture, these heroes reveal the very opposite - they reveal a strength and integrity of character that can build a great country, a great future.</p><p>We are here tonight because we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say "yes"

I believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with Kenya and with Africa.</p><p>So don't tell me that Democrats won't defend this country.</p><p>Of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see.</p><p>For only through this phased redeployment can we send a clear message to the Iraqi factions that the U.S. is not going to hold together this country indefinitely ?</p><p>It is time to give Iraqis their country back.</p><p>And I know that the vast majority of people in this country desperately want to change this.</p><p>Instead of unifying the country to move forward on solving problems, it divides neighbor from neighbor.</p><p>These are serious times for our country, and with their votes two weeks ago, Americans demanded a feasible strategy with defined goals in Iraq ?</p><p>By focusing on building strong, independent institutions - like an anti-corruption commission with real authority - rather than cults of personality, they make a contribution to their country that will last longer than their own lives.</p><p>We all put our country first.</p><p>To reach such a solution, we must communicate clearly and effectively to the factions in Iraq that the days of asking, urging, and waiting for them to take control of their own country are coming to an end.</p><p>His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years.</p><p>I don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a country truly committed to reform could start.</p><p>Since that time I have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those I heard from my relatives here in Kenya on my last trip to this country.</p><p>It's humbling, but in my heart I know you didn't come here just for me, you came here because you believe in what this country can be.</p><p>A year that is ending with an attempt by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group to determine what can be done about a country that is quickly spiraling out of control.</p><p>The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight.</p><p>When people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups.</p><p>It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.</p><p>I know that while recent reports have pointed to strong economic growth in this country, 56% of Kenyans still live in poverty.</p><p>Will she see greater opportunities for every citizen of this country?</p><p>We know as well the talent, the intelligence, and the creativity that exists in this country.</p><p>We are a better country than this.</p><p>The first is that we should be more modest in our belief that we can impose democracy on a country through military force.</p><p>Today, we're starting to see that the Kenyan people want more than a simple changing of the guard, more than piecemeal reforms to a crisis that's crippling their country.</p><p>to pressure the Iraqi leadership to finally come to a political agreement between the warring factions that can create some sense of stability in the country and bring this conflict under control.</p><p>That policy-by-slogan will no longer pass as an acceptable form of debate in this country.</p><p>And you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether

job they started on 9/11.</p><p>Rather, the question is what strategies, imperfect though they may be, are most likely to achieve the best outcome in Iraq, one that will ultimately put us on a more effective course to deal with international terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and other critical threats to our security.</p><p>The time for waiting in Iraq is over.</p><p>I spoke here a year ago and delivered a message about Iraq that was similar to the one I did today.</p><p>The notion that Iraq would quickly and easily become a bulwark of flourishing democracy in the Middle East was not a plan for victory, but an ideological fantasy.</p><p>Iraq is descending into chaos based on ethnic divisions that were around long before American troops arrived.</p><p>Last week, without a trace of irony, the President even chose Vietnam as the backdrop for remarks counseling “patience” with his policies in Iraq.</p><p>In such a scenario, it is conceivable that a significantly reduced U.S. force might remain in Iraq for a more extended period of time.</p><p>The goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of Iraq, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various Iraqi factions towards a political solution.</p><p>“rejected the notion of an American ‘timeline’ for action on urgent Iraqi political issues; ordered American commanders to lift checkpoints they had set up around the Shiite district of Sadr City to hunt for a kidnapped American soldier and a fugitive Shiite death squad leader; and blamed the Americans for the deteriorating security situation in Iraq.”
This is now the reality of Iraq.</p><p>The American soldiers I met when I traveled to Iraq this year were performing their duties with bravery, with brilliance, and without question.</p><p>And so the question is not whether there is some magic formula for success, or guarantee against failure, in Iraq.</p><p>You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying Iraq.</p><p>This force could help prevent the conflict in Iraq from becoming a wider war, consolidate gains in Northern Iraq, reassure allies in the Gulf, allow our troops to strike directly at al Qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region.</p><p>Now, I am hopeful that the Iraq Study Group emerges next month with a series of proposals around which we can begin to build a bipartisan consensus.</p><p>And a report by our own intelligence agencies has concluded that al Qaeda is successfully using the war in Iraq to recruit a new generation of terrorists for its war on America.</p><p>There is no reason to believe that more of the same will achieve these objectives in Iraq.</p><p>Drawing down our troops in Iraq will allow us to redeploy additional troops to Northern Iraq and elsewhere in the region as an over-the-horizon force.</p><p>As we change strategy in Iraq, we should also think about what Iraq has taught us about America’s strategy in the wider struggle against rogue threats and international terrorism.</p><p>Senators, Republican and Democrat, including myself, had also voted in favor of a resolution demanding that 2006 be a year of significant transition in Iraq.</p><p>any U.S. strategy must address the problem of sectarian militias in Iraq.</p><p>These are serious times for our country, and with their votes two weeks ago, Americans demanded a feasible strategy with defined goals in Iraq ?</p><p>A year in which well-respected Republicans like John Warner, former Administration officials like Colin Powell, generals who have served in Iraq, and intelligence experts have all said that what we are doing is not working.</p><p>To reach such a solution, we must communicate clearly and effectively to the factions in Iraq that the days of asking, urging, and waiting for them to take control of their own country are coming to an end.</p><p>if the Iranians and Syrians think they can use Iraq as another Afghanistan or a staging area from which to attack Israel or other countries, they are badly mistaken.</p><p>A year that is ending with an attempt by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group to determine what can be done about a country that is quickly spiraling out of control.</p><p>What is absolutely clear is that it is not enough for the President to respond to Iraq’s reality by saying that he is “open to” or “interested in” new ideas while acting as if all that’s required is doing more of the same.</p><p>The redeployment could be temporarily suspended if the parties in Iraq reach an effective political arrangement that stabilizes the situation and they offer us a clear and compelling rationale for maintaining certain troop levels.</p><p>namely, preventing Iraq from becoming what Afghanistan once was, maintaining our influence in the Middle East, and forging a political settlement to stop the sectarian violence so that our troops can come home.</p><p>that it will be up to them to form a viable government that can effectively run and secure Iraq.</p><p>So far, Congress has given the Administration unprecedented flexibility in determining how to spend more than $20 billion dollars in Iraq.</p><p>The President’s decision to go to war in Iraq has had disastrous consequences for Afghanistan -- we have seen a fierce Taliban offensive, a spike in terrorist attacks, and a narcotrafficking problem spiral out of control.</p><p>A few Tuesdays ago, the American people embraced this seriousness with regards to America’s policy in Iraq.</p><p>Many who supported the original decision to go to war in Iraq have argued that it has been a failure of implementation.</p><p>I said then and believe now that Saddam Hussein was a ruthless dictator who craved weapons of mass destruction but posed no imminent threat to the United States; that a war in Iraq would harm, not help, our efforts to defeat al Qaeda and finish the job in Afghanistan; and that an invasion would require an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.</p><p>For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face.</p><p>It may be politically advantageous for the President to simply define victory as staying and defeat as leaving, but it prevents a serious conversation about the realistic objectives we can still achieve in Iraq.</p><p>By redeploying from Iraq to Afghanistan, we will answer NATO’s call for more troops and provide a much-needed boost to this critical fight against terrorism.</p><p>The overwhelming presence of our troops, our intelligence, and our resources in Iraq has stretched our military to the breaking point and distracted us from the growing threats of a dangerous world.</p></td></tr><tr><td>america

leadership in the cause of a more progressive America.</p><p>They can say that this was the time when America learned to dream again.</p><p>This too is part of America's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort.</p><p>These are Americans who still believe in an America where anything's possible - they just don't think their leaders do.</p><p>But what the people heard instead - people of every creed and color, from every walk of life - is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked.</p><p>I want us to take up the unfinished business of perfecting our union, and building a better America.</p><p>She believed that over a span of three centuries, she had seen enough to know that there is no challenge too great, no injustice too crippling, no destiny too far out of reach for America.</p><p>They have not served a Red America or a Blue America - they have served the United States of America.</p><p>America, we are better than these last eight years.</p><p>You know, you probably never thought you'd hear this at a Take Back America conference, but Newt Gingrich made a great point a few weeks ago.</p><p>Thank you, and God Bless the United States of America.</p><p>That won't keep America safe.</p><p>How she saw unions rise up and a middle-class prosper, and watched immigrants leave distant shores in search of an idea known as America.</p><p>America, it's time to start bringing our troops home.</p><p>Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America.</p><p>And then someday, someday, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was the time when America renewed its purpose.</p><p>It was here, in Springfield, where I saw all that is America converge - farmers and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard.</p><p>Let's be the generation that says right here, right now, that we will have universal health care in America by the end of the next president's first term.</p><p>And Democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money.</p><p>And a report by our own intelligence agencies has concluded that al Qaeda is successfully using the war in Iraq to recruit a new generation of terrorists for its war on America.</p><p>And it is time to refocus America’s efforts on the wider struggle yet to be won.</p><p>As we change strategy in Iraq, we should also think about what Iraq has taught us about America’s strategy in the wider struggle against rogue threats and international terrorism.</p><p>Never again can we expect the oceans that surround America to keep us safe from attacks on our own soil.</p><p>Let's be the generation that finally frees America from the tyranny of oil.</p><p>It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America.</p><p>America, our work will not be easy.</p><p>They can say that this was the time when America found its way.</p><p>And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future.</p><p>It's time for us to change America.</p><p>And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance.</p><p>That's the promise of America - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper.</p><p>But I stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring.</p><p>A while ago, I was reading through Jonathan Kozol's new book, Shame of a Nation, which tells of his travels to underprivileged schools across America.</p><p>Let's make college more affordable, and let's invest in scientific research, and let's lay down broadband lines through the heart of inner cities and rural towns all across America.</p><p>Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.</p><p>Let's be the generation that ends poverty in America.</p><p>And I accepted the job, sight unseen, motivated then by a single, simple, powerful idea - that I might play a small part in building a better America.</p><p>America, now is not the time for small plans.</p><p>As I said at the outset, I did not know my father well - he returned to Kenya from America when I was still young.</p><p>Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent.</p><p>Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility - that's the essence of America's promise.</p><p>And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise abroad.</p><p>Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow.</p><p>America, we cannot turn back.</p><p>America, this is one of those moments.</p><p>A few Tuesdays ago, the American people embraced this seriousness with regards to America’s policy in Iraq.</p><p>Let it be said that we are the party of an energy independent America.</p><p>That's what America is.</p><p>I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America.</p><p>My friends, we meet here today at a time where we find ourselves at a crossroads in America's history.</p><p>We need to keep these lessons in mind as we think about the broader threats America now faces ?</p></td></tr>  </tbody>
