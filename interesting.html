This is now the reality of Iraq.</p><p>Because we've always fought to bring all of our people under the blanket of the <b>american</b> Dream.</p><p>It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create <b>american</b> jobs, look out for <b>american</b> workers, and play by the rules of the road.</p><p>It's time to admit that no amount of <b>american</b> lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil war.</p><p>A few Tuesdays ago, the <b>american</b> people embraced this seriousness with regards to America’s policy in Iraq.</p><p>And now, after three long years of watching the same back and forth in Washington, the <b>american</b> people have sent a clear message that the days of using the war on terror as a political football are over.</p><p>Let us keep that promise - that <b>american</b> promise - and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess.</p><p>When I came here and gave a speech on this war a year ago, I suggested that we begin to move towards a phased redeployment of <b>american</b> troops from Iraqi soil.</p><p>My own city of Chicago has been the home of some of the most corrupt local politics in <b>american</b> history, from patronage machines to questionable elections.</p><p>As a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the U.S. troops remaining in Iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and <b>american</b> enclaves like the Green Zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists.</p><p>and that is the loss of our government’s credibility with the <b>american</b> people.</p><p>I'll make it easier for the <b>american</b> people to afford these new cars.</p><p>And ever since I met this frail, one-hundred-and-five-year-old African-<b>american</b> woman who had found the strength to leave her house and come to a rally because she believed that her voice mattered, I've thought about all she's seen in her life.</p><p>And we will keep our promise to every young <b>american</b> - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education.</p><p>And polls show that almost two-thirds of all Iraqis now sympathize with attacks on <b>american</b> soldiers.</p><p>Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single <b>american</b>.</p><p>It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the <b>american</b> people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America.</p><p>Tonight, I say to the <b>american</b> people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land - enough!</p><p>We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President - when the average <b>american</b> family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush.</p><p>Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts <b>american</b> wages by hiring illegal workers.</p><p>Instead, it is that <b>american</b> spirit - that <b>american</b> promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.</p><p>It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one <b>american</b> family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.</p><p>Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the <b>american</b> workers and small businesses who deserve it.</p><p>It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every <b>american</b> who's willing to work.</p><p>In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the <b>american</b> people ?</p><p>Moreover, it could be suspended if at any point U.S. commanders believe that a further reduction would put <b>american</b> troops in danger.</p><p>We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major <b>american</b> city drowns before our eyes.</p><p>Iraq is descending into chaos based on ethnic divisions that were around long before <b>american</b> troops arrived.</p><p>This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the <b>american</b> promise alive.</p><p>The <b>american</b> soldiers I met when I traveled to Iraq this year were performing their duties with bravery, with brilliance, and without question.</p><p>Change happens because the <b>american</b> people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time.</p><p>The <b>american</b> people have been extraordinarily resolved.</p><p>We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the <b>american</b> promise has been threatened once more.</p><p>300,000 Iraqi security forces have supposedly been recruited and trained over the last two years, and yet <b>american</b> troop levels have not been reduced by a single soldier.</p><p>But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at <b>american</b> University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet Union.</p><p>And it is not enough for the President to tell us that victory in this war is simply a matter of <b>american</b> resolve.</p><p>But instead of effectively targeting this aid, we have seen some of the largest waste, fraud, and abuse of foreign aid in <b>american</b> history.</p><p>That in a global economy that's more connected and more competitive - we are the party that will guarantee every <b>american</b> an affordable, world-class, top-notch, life-long education - from early childhood to high school, from college to on-the-job training.</p><p>And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the <b>american</b> people about why we are there and how we will win.</p><p>the <b>american</b> people have determined that all these phrases have become meaningless in the face of a conflict that grows more deadly and chaotic with each passing day ?</p></td></tr><tr ><td ><h3><span id = "people"></span>People (69)</h3><p><a href="#top">Back</a></p></td><td><p>doc4.txt</p><p>doc6.txt</p><p>doc2.txt</p><p>doc1.txt</p><p>doc5.txt</p><p>doc3.txt</p></td><td><p>The history of Africa is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of <b>people</b> fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like Nkrumah and Kenyatta and Mandela, but also ordinary <b>people</b> who endured great hardship, from Ghana to South Africa, to secure self-determination in the face of great odds.</p><p>And she saw young <b>people</b> of every race and every creed take a bus down to Mississippi and Alabama to register voters because they believed.</p><p>Because <b>people</b> just couldn't pronounce it.</p><p>One that serves its <b>people</b> and is free from corruption.</p><p>Of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the <b>people</b>, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see.</p><p>But through his will and his words, he moved a nation and helped free a <b>people</b>.</p><p>Today, the Iraqi landscape is littered with ill-conceived, half-finished projects that have done almost nothing to help the Iraqi <b>people</b> or stabilize the country.</p><p>I saw that the problems <b>people</b> faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill.</p><p>and that is the loss of our government’s credibility with the American <b>people</b>.</p><p>That beneath all the differences of race and region, faith and station, we are one <b>people</b>.</p><p>The sweeping changes brought by revolutions in technology have torn down walls between business and government and <b>people</b> and places all over the globe.</p><p>do not just come from deposing a tyrant and handing out ballots; they are only realized once the personal and material security of a <b>people</b> is ensured as well.</p><p>Now, few <b>people</b> understand these challenges better than the co-founder of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Dick Lugar, and this is something that became particularly clear to me during one incident on the trip.</p><p>I joined with pastors and lay-<b>people</b> to deal with communities that had been ravaged by plant closings.</p><p>Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were <b>people</b> who counted on the brakes that they made.</p><p>The President should announce to the Iraqi <b>people</b> that our policy will include a gradual and substantial reduction in U.S. forces.</p><p>It's a time where you can go to any town hall or street corner or coffee shop and hear <b>people</b> express the same anxiety about the future; hear them convey the same uncertainty about the direction we're headed as a country.</p><p>To begin with, I discovered the warmth and sense of community that the <b>people</b> of Kenya possess - their sense of hopefulness even in the face of great difficulty.</p><p>It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American <b>people</b> - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America.</p><p>We measure progress by how many <b>people</b> can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma.</p><p>And the second thing <b>people</b> would ask me was, "You seem like a nice young man.</p><p>The Kenyan <b>people</b> are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels.</p><p>And as <b>people</b> have looked away in disillusionment and frustration, we know what's filled the void.</p><p>In the face of Depression, we put <b>people</b> back to work and lifted millions out of poverty.</p><p>Instead of opening businesses and engaging in commerce, <b>people</b> come to rely on patronage and payback as a means of advancing.</p><p>Because we've always fought to bring all of our <b>people</b> under the blanket of the American Dream.</p><p>The Kenyan media has been courageous in uncovering and reporting on some of the most blatant abuses of the system, and there has been a growing recognition among <b>people</b> and politicians that this is a critical issue.</p><p>In the face of a politics that's shut you out, that's told you to settle, that's divided us for too long, you believe we can be one <b>people</b>, reaching for what's possible, building that more perfect union.</p><p>If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone <b>people</b> should run from.</p><p>And I understood the question because it revealed the cynicism <b>people</b> feel about public life today.</p><p>But what the <b>people</b> heard instead - <b>people</b> of every creed and color, from every walk of life - is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked.</p><p>A foreign policy that gives hope and opportunity to the <b>people</b> of this great continent.</p><p>When <b>people</b> are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, <b>people</b> will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups.</p><p>And she saw <b>people</b> lining up to vote for the first time - and she got in that line - and she never forgot it.</p><p>Some of the worst actors on the international stage can also take advantage of the collective exhaustion and outrage that <b>people</b> feel with official corruption, as we've seen with Islamic extremists who promise purification, but deliver totalitarianism.</p><p>In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the American <b>people</b> ?</p><p>And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American <b>people</b> about why we are there and how we will win.</p><p>We're distracted from our real failures, and told to blame the other party, or gay <b>people</b>, or immigrants.</p><p>In the end, if the <b>people</b> cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost.</p><p>It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one <b>people</b> - as Americans.</p><p>For that is our unyielding faith - that in the face of impossible odds, <b>people</b> who love their country can change it.</p><p>A few Tuesdays ago, the American <b>people</b> embraced this seriousness with regards to America’s policy in Iraq.</p><p>And now, after three long years of watching the same back and forth in Washington, the American <b>people</b> have sent a clear message that the days of using the war on terror as a political football are over.</p><p>The American <b>people</b> have been extraordinarily resolved.</p><p>In the young <b>people</b> who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved again after a very long time.</p><p>Outstanding career officials who run the Nunn-Lugar program -- <b>people</b> like Col. Jim Reid and Andy Weber who are here this morning -- will be there every step of the way to ensure that U.S. interests are protected.</p><p>Whether it's the war or Katrina or their health care or their jobs, you hear <b>people</b> say that we've finally arrived at a moment where something must change.</p><p>I know from these stories that my father was not a perfect man - that he made his share of mistakes and disappointed his share of <b>people</b> in his lifetime.</p><p>But while corruption is a problem we all share, here in Kenya it is a crisis - a crisis that's robbing an honest <b>people</b> of the opportunities they have fought for - the opportunity they deserve.</p><p>And we also know that the more <b>people</b> there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe.</p><p>How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax <b>people</b>'s benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement?</p><p>Our faith has been shaken, but the <b>people</b> running Washington aren't willing to make us believe again.</p><p>Change happens because the American <b>people</b> demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time.</p><p>It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in <b>people</b> instead of the worst.</p><p>Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that <b>people</b> cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism.</p><p>Today, we're starting to see that the Kenyan <b>people</b> want more than a simple changing of the guard, more than piecemeal reforms to a crisis that's crippling their country.</p><p>Tonight, I say to the American <b>people</b>, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land - enough!</p><p>I don't think this administration is full of stupid <b>people</b> - I think there are a lot of smart folks in there.</p><p>In a true democracy, it is what happens between elections that is the true measure of how a government treats its <b>people</b>.</p><p>the American <b>people</b> have determined that all these phrases have become meaningless in the face of a conflict that grows more deadly and chaotic with each passing day ?</p><p>But too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and <b>people</b> turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own.</p><p>The Kenyan <b>people</b> are the ultimate guardians against abuses.</p><p>Looking out at this crowd of young <b>people</b>, I have faith that you will fight this fight too.</p><p>And I know that the vast majority of <b>people</b> in this country desperately want to change this.</p><p>I'll make it easier for the American <b>people</b> to afford these new cars.</p></td></tr><tr ><td ><h3><span id = "country"></span>Country (68)</h3><p><a href="#top">Back</a></p></td><td><p>doc4.txt</p><p>doc2.txt</p><p>doc1.txt</p><p>doc5.txt</p><p>doc3.txt</p></td><td><p>The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this <b>country</b> great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight.</p><p>When people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the <b>country</b>, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups.</p><p>The first is that we should be more modest in our belief that we can impose democracy on a <b>country</b> through military force.</p><p>You enjoy a robust civil society; a press that's free, fair, and honest; and a strong partnership with my own <b>country</b> that has resulted in critical cooperation on terrorist issues, real strides in fighting disease and poverty, and an important alliance on fostering regional stability.</p><p>By rejecting the insulting idea that corruption is somehow a part of Kenyan culture, these heroes reveal the very opposite - they reveal a strength and integrity of character that can build a great <b>country</b>, a great future.</p><p>I know that while recent reports have pointed to strong economic growth in this <b>country</b>, 56% of Kenyans still live in poverty.</p><p>The idea that everybody has a stake in the <b>country</b>, that we're all in it together and everybody's got a shot at opportunity.</p><p>In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the <b>country</b> with the help of student loans and scholarships.</p><p>All of us running for president will travel around the <b>country</b> offering ten-point plans and making grand speeches; all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead the <b>country</b>.</p><p>We know as well the talent, the intelligence, and the creativity that exists in this <b>country</b>.</p><p>Politics doesn't have to divide us on this anymore - we can work together to keep our <b>country</b> safe.</p><p>His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the <b>country</b> for many, many years.</p><p>I've had enough of being told that we can't afford body armor for our troops and health care for our veterans and benefits for the wounded heroes who've risked their lives for this <b>country</b>.</p><p>It is time to give Iraqis their <b>country</b> back.</p><p>That policy-by-slogan will no longer pass as an acceptable form of debate in this <b>country</b>.</p><p>For only through this phased redeployment can we send a clear message to the Iraqi factions that the U.S. is not going to hold together this <b>country</b> indefinitely ?</p><p>He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this <b>country</b>, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words:
Had enough?</p><p>As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my <b>country</b>, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with Kenya and with Africa.</p><p>Today, we're starting to see that the Kenyan people want more than a simple changing of the guard, more than piecemeal reforms to a crisis that's crippling their <b>country</b>.</p><p>And I know that the vast majority of people in this <b>country</b> desperately want to change this.</p><p>We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this <b>country</b>.</p><p>But to guard against isolationist sentiments in this <b>country</b>, we must change conditions in Iraq and the policy that has characterized our time there ?</p><p>Our time to leave our children a <b>country</b> that is freer and kinder, more prosperous and more just than the place we grew up.</p><p>And we are here because we love this <b>country</b> too much to let the next four years look like the last eight.</p><p>Will she see greater opportunities for every citizen of this <b>country</b>?</p><p>The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our <b>country</b> with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect.</p><p>It's a time where you can go to any town hall or street corner or coffee shop and hear people express the same anxiety about the future; hear them convey the same uncertainty about the direction we're headed as a <b>country</b>.</p><p>A year that is ending with an attempt by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group to determine what can be done about a <b>country</b> that is quickly spiraling out of control.</p><p>This <b>country</b> is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work.</p><p>Of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your <b>country</b> has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see.</p><p>We all put our <b>country</b> first.</p><p>According to a Pew survey, 42% of Americans now agree with the statement that the U.S. should "mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own.”
We cannot afford to be a <b>country</b> of isolationists right now.</p><p>And I've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this <b>country</b>.</p><p>It is that promise that has always set this <b>country</b> apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.</p><p>This <b>country</b> is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news.</p><p>Will she see a <b>country</b> that is freer and kinder, more tolerant and more just than the one she grew up in?</p><p>For that is our unyielding faith - that in the face of impossible odds, people who love their <b>country</b> can change it.</p><p>I don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a <b>country</b> truly committed to reform could start.</p><p>And you will determine the direction of this <b>country</b> in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger Kenya where everyone rises together.</p><p>So don't tell me that Democrats won't defend this <b>country</b>.</p><p>Today, the Iraqi landscape is littered with ill-conceived, half-finished projects that have done almost nothing to help the Iraqi people or stabilize the <b>country</b>.</p><p>By focusing on building strong, independent institutions - like an anti-corruption commission with real authority - rather than cults of personality, they make a contribution to their <b>country</b> that will last longer than their own lives.</p><p>It's humbling, but in my heart I know you didn't come here just for me, you came here because you believe in what this <b>country</b> can be.</p><p>We are here tonight because we believe that in this <b>country</b>, we have it within our power to say "yes" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew.</p><p>And we should take heart, because we've changed this <b>country</b> before.</p><p>We are a better <b>country</b> than this.</p><p>These are serious times for our <b>country</b>, and with their votes two weeks ago, Americans demanded a feasible strategy with defined goals in Iraq ?</p><p>Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this <b>country</b> for a third.</p><p>And so I am eager to have this argument not just with the President, but the entire Republican Party over what this <b>country</b> is about.</p><p>To reach such a solution, we must communicate clearly and effectively to the factions in Iraq that the days of asking, urging, and waiting for them to take control of their own <b>country</b> are coming to an end.</p><p>And let's allow our unions and their organizers to lift up this <b>country</b>'s middle-class again.</p><p>You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this <b>country</b>.</p><p>This <b>country</b> of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich.</p><p>And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your <b>country</b>, we will

political agreement between the warring factions that can create some sense of stability in the <b>country</b> and bring this conflict under control.</p><p>I think he loves his <b>country</b>.</p><p>I

href="#top">Back</a></p></td><td><p>doc1.txt</p><p>doc3.txt</p><p>doc2.txt</p><p>doc5.txt</p></td><td><p>The goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of <b>iraq</b>, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various <b>iraq</b>i factions towards a political solution.</p><p>Drawing down our troops in <b>iraq</b> will allow us to redeploy additional troops to Northern <b>iraq</b> and elsewhere in the region as an over-the-horizon force.</p><p>But to guard against isolationist sentiments in this country, we must change conditions in <b>iraq</b> and the policy that has characterized our time there ?</p><p>These are serious times for our country, and with their votes two weeks ago, Americans demanded a feasible strategy with defined goals in <b>iraq</b> ?</p><p>The National Intelligence Estimate, which details how we’re creating more terrorists in <b>iraq</b> than we’re defeating, is the most obvious example of how the war is hurting our efforts in the larger battle against terrorism.</p><p>In such a scenario, it is conceivable that a significantly reduced U.S. force might remain in <b>iraq</b> for a more extended period of time.</p><p>Rather, the question is what strategies, imperfect though they may be, are most likely to achieve the best outcome in <b>iraq</b>, one that will ultimately put us on a more effective course to deal with international terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and other critical threats to our security.</p><p>The third part of our strategy should be to link continued economic aid in <b>iraq</b> with the existence of tangible progress toward a political settlement.</p><p>Last week, without a trace of irony, the President even chose Vietnam as the backdrop for remarks counseling “patience” with his policies in <b>iraq</b>.</p><p>Senators, Republican and Democrat, including myself, had also voted in favor of a resolution demanding that 2006 be a year of significant transition in <b>iraq</b>.</p><p>Now, I am hopeful that the <b>iraq</b> Study Group emerges next month with a series of proposals around which we can begin to build a bipartisan consensus.</p><p>But all of this cannot come to pass until we bring an end to this war in <b>iraq</b>.</p><p>To reach such a solution, we must communicate clearly and effectively to the factions in <b>iraq</b> that the days of asking, urging, and waiting for them to take control of their own country are coming to an end.</p><p>I have long said that the only solution in <b>iraq</b> is a political one.</p><p>Much has been written about how the military invasion of <b>iraq</b> was planned without any thought to what political situation we would find after Baghdad fell.</p><p>a phased redeployment of U.S. troops from <b>iraq</b> on a timetable that would begin in four to six months.</p><p>We would make clear in such a scenario that the United States would not be maintaining permanent military bases in <b>iraq</b>, but would do what was necessary to help prevent a total collapse of the <b>iraq</b>i state and further polarization of <b>iraq</b>i society.</p><p><b>iraq</b> is descending into chaos based on ethnic divisions that were around long before American troops arrived.</p><p>What is absolutely clear is that it is not enough for the President to respond to <b>iraq</b>’s reality by saying that he is “open to” or “interested in” new ideas while acting as if all that’s required is doing more of the same.</p><p>This force could help prevent the conflict in <b>iraq</b> from becoming a wider war, consolidate gains in Northern <b>iraq</b>, reassure allies in the Gulf, allow our troops to strike directly at al Qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region.</p><p>In the absence of a genuine commitment on the part of all of the factions in <b>iraq</b> to deal with this issue, it is doubtful that a unified <b>iraq</b>i government can function for long, and it is doubtful that U.S. forces, no matter how large, can prevent an escalation of widespread sectarian killing.</p><p>The President’s decision to go to war in <b>iraq</b> has had disastrous consequences for Afghanistan -- we have seen a fierce Taliban offensive, a spike in terrorist attacks, and a narcotrafficking problem spiral out of control.</p><p>So far, Congress has given the Administration unprecedented flexibility in determining how to spend more than $20 billion dollars in <b>iraq</b>.</p><p>There is no reason to believe that more of the same will achieve these objectives in <b>iraq</b>.</p><p>That if you say the words "plan for victory" and point to the number of schools painted and roads paved and cell phones used in <b>iraq</b>, no one will notice the nearly 2,500 flag-draped coffins that have arrived at Dover Air Force base.</p><p>if the Iranians and Syrians think they can use <b>iraq</b> as another Afghanistan or a staging area from which to attack Israel or other countries, they are badly mistaken.</p><p>They have battled insurgents, secured cities, and maintained some semblance of order in <b>iraq</b>.</p><p>The time for waiting in <b>iraq</b> is over.</p><p>The redeployment could be temporarily suspended if the parties in <b>iraq</b> reach an effective political arrangement that stabilizes the situation and they offer us a clear and compelling rationale for maintaining certain troop levels.</p><p>The notion that <b>iraq</b> would quickly and easily become a bulwark of flourishing democracy in the Middle East was not a plan for victory, but an ideological fantasy.</p><p>namely, preventing <b>iraq</b> from becoming what Afghanistan once was, maintaining our influence in the Middle East, and forging a political settlement to stop the sectarian violence so that our troops can come home.</p><p>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from <b>iraq</b> has been echoed by the <b>iraq</b>i government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that <b>iraq</b> has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.</p><p>Finally, we have to realize that the entire Middle East has an enormous stake in the outcome of <b>iraq</b>, and we must engage neighboring countries in finding a solution.</p><p>As we change strategy in <b>iraq</b>, we should also think about what <b>iraq</b> has taught us about America’s strategy in the wider struggle against rogue threats and international terrorism.</p><p>A year in which well-respected Republicans like John Warner, former Administration officials like Colin Powell, generals who have served in <b>iraq</b>, and intelligence experts have all said that what we are doing is not working.</p><p>The American soldiers I met when I traveled to <b>iraq</b> this year were performing their duties with bravery, with brilliance, and without question.</p><p>You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying <b>iraq</b>.</p><p>We've seen our children leave for <b>iraq</b> and terrorists threaten to finish the job they started on 9/11.</p><p>threats we haven’t paid nearly enough attention to because we have been distracted in <b>iraq</b>.</p><p>Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from <b>iraq</b> and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill.</p><p>But neither Iran nor Syria want to see a security vacuum in <b>iraq</b> filled with chaos, terrorism, refugees, and violence, as it could have a destabilizing effect throughout the entire region ?</p><p>Many who supported the original decision to go to war in <b>iraq</b> have argued that it has been a failure of implementation.</p><p>“rejected the notion of an American ‘timeline’ for action on urgent <b>iraq</b>i political issues; ordered American commanders to lift checkpoints they had set up around the Shiite district of Sadr City to hunt for a kidnapped American soldier and a fugitive Shiite death squad leader; and blamed the Americans for the deteriorating security situation in <b>iraq</b>.”
This is now the reality of <b>iraq</b>.</p><p>A year that is ending with an attempt by the bipartisan <b>iraq</b> Study Group to determine what can be done about a country that is quickly spiraling out of control.</p><p>A few Tuesdays ago, the American people embraced this seriousness with regards to America’s policy in <b>iraq</b>.</p><p>By redeploying from <b>iraq</b> to Afghanistan, we will answer NATO’s call for more troops and provide a much-needed boost to this critical fight against terrorism.</p><p>that it will be up to them to form a viable government that can effectively run and secure <b>iraq</b>.</p><p>And when all else fails, when Katrina happens, or the death toll in <b>iraq</b> mounts, we've been told that our crises are somebody else's fault.</p><p>And so the question is not whether there is some magic formula for success, or guarantee against failure, in <b>iraq</b>.</p><p>And a report by our own intelligence agencies has concluded that al Qaeda is successfully using the war in <b>iraq</b> to recruit a new generation of terrorists for its war on America.</p><p>For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to <b>iraq</b> just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face.</p><p>I will end this war in <b>iraq</b> responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan.</p><p>As a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the U.S. troops remaining in <b>iraq</b> should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and American enclaves like the Green Zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists.</p><p>There is one other place where our mistakes in <b>iraq</b> have cost us dearly ?</p><p>I spoke here a year ago and delivered a message about <b>iraq</b> that was similar to the one I did today.</p><p>I said then and believe now that Saddam Hussein was a ruthless dictator who craved weapons of mass destruction but posed no imminent threat to the United States; that a war in <b>iraq</b> would harm, not help, our efforts to defeat al Qaeda and finish the job in Afghanistan; and that an invasion would require an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.</p><p>The overwhelming presence of our troops, our intelligence, and our resources in <b>iraq</b> has stretched our military to the breaking point and distracted us from the growing threats of a dangerous world.</p><p>It may be politically advantageous for the President to simply define victory as staying and defeat as leaving, but it prevents a serious conversation about the realistic objectives we can still achieve in <b>iraq</b>.</p><p>any U.S. strategy must address the problem of sectarian militias in <b>iraq</b>.</p></td></tr><tr ><td ><h3><span id = "america"></span>America (54)</h3><p><a href="#top">Back</a></p></td><td><p>doc4.txt</p><p>doc2.txt</p><p>doc1.txt</p><p>doc5.txt</p><p>doc3.txt</p></td><td><p>But I stand before you tonight because all across <b>america</b> something is stirring.</p><p>And I will not settle for an <b>america</b> where some kids don't have that chance.</p><p>And then someday, someday, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was the time when <b>america</b> renewed its purpose.</p><p>Never again can we expect the oceans that surround <b>america</b> to keep us safe from attacks on our own soil.</p><p>How she saw unions rise up and a middle-class prosper, and watched immigrants leave distant shores in search of an idea known as <b>america</b>.</p><p><b>america</b>, we cannot turn back.</p><p>Let's be the generation that finally frees <b>america</b> from the tyranny of oil.</p><p>Let's be the generation that says right here, right now, that we will have universal health care in <b>america</b> by the end of the next president's first term.</p><p>I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in <b>america</b>.</p><p>We need to keep these lessons in mind as we think about the broader threats <b>america</b> now faces ?</p><p>It's time for us to change <b>america</b>.</p><p>A few Tuesdays ago, the <b>america</b>n people embraced this seriousness with regards to <b>america</b>’s policy in Iraq.</p><p>But what the people heard instead - people of every creed and color, from every walk of life - is that in <b>america</b>, our destiny is inextricably linked.</p><p>And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep <b>america</b>'s promise abroad.</p><p>And I accepted the job, sight unseen, motivated then by a single, simple, powerful idea - that I might play a small part in building a better <b>america</b>.</p><p>These are <b>america</b>ns who still believe in an <b>america</b> where anything's possible - they just don't think their leaders do.</p><p><b>america</b>, this is one of those moments.</p><p>As we change strategy in Iraq, we should also think about what Iraq has taught us about <b>america</b>’s strategy in the wider struggle against rogue threats and international terrorism.</p><p>They can say that this was the time when <b>america</b> found its way.</p><p><b>america</b>, now is not the time for small plans.</p><p>And Democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling <b>america</b>'s promise will require more than just money.</p><p>It was here, in Springfield, where I saw all that is <b>america</b> converge - farmers and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard.</p><p>She believed that over a span of three centuries, she had seen enough to know that there is no challenge too great, no injustice too crippling, no destiny too far out of reach for <b>america</b>.</p><p>A while ago, I was reading through Jonathan Kozol's new book, Shame of a Nation, which tells of his travels to underprivileged schools across <b>america</b>.</p><p>Thank you, and God Bless the United States of <b>america</b>.</p><p>It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the <b>america</b>n people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful <b>america</b>.</p><p>My friends, we meet here today at a time where we find ourselves at a crossroads in <b>america</b>'s history.</p><p><b>america</b>, we are better than these last eight years.</p><p>Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in <b>america</b> should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent.</p><p>They can say that this was the time when <b>america</b> learned to dream again.</p><p>Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help <b>america</b> grow.</p><p>And a report by our own intelligence agencies has concluded that al Qaeda is successfully using the war in Iraq to recruit a new generation of terrorists for its war on <b>america</b>.</p><p>Let it be said that we are the party of an energy independent <b>america</b>.</p><p>That's the promise of <b>america</b> - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper.</p><p>As I said at the outset, I did not know my father well - he returned to Kenya from <b>america</b> when I was still young.</p><p>And I will restore our moral standing, so that <b>america</b> is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future.</p><p>And it is time to refocus <b>america</b>’s efforts on the wider struggle yet to be won.</p><p>They have not served a Red <b>america</b> or a Blue <b>america</b> - they have served the United States of <b>america</b>.</p><p>Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in <b>america</b>, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.</p><p>I want us to take up the unfinished business of perfecting our union, and building a better <b>america</b>.</p><p>Let's be the generation that ends poverty in <b>america</b>.</p><p>This too is part of <b>america</b>'s promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort.</p><p>That's what <b>america</b> is.</p><p>Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in <b>america</b>.</p><p>That won't keep <b>america</b> safe.</p><p><b>america</b>, it's time to start bringing our troops home.</p><p>Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility - that's the essence of <b>america</b>'s promise.</p><p>Thank you Roger Hickey and Bob Borosage for bringing us all together today and thank you for your leadership in the cause of a more progressive <b>america</b>.</p><p>Let's make college more affordable, and let's invest in scientific research, and let's lay down broadband lines through the heart of inner cities and rural towns all across <b>america</b>.</p><p>You know, you probably never thought you'd hear this at a Take Back <b>america</b> conference, but Newt Gingrich made a great point a few weeks ago.</p><p><b>america</b>, our work will not be easy.</p></td></tr>  </tbody>
